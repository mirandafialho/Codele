# Codele

Wordle: Developer's Edition. A Blazor Web app built for demoing C# Dev Kit.

This application used to demo C# Dev Kit as part of a [multi-part .NET beginner series on C# Dev Kit and VS Code](https://aka.ms/dotnet/beginnervideos/learn/vscode).

Inspired by [leslierichardson95/codele-devkit-demo](https://github.com/leslierichardson95/codele-devkit-demo) project. Upgraded to .NET 9.0 version.
